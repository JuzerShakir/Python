Topic : How to while-loop in python"""
"""----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"""

#while loop checks the condition, if true will run a block of code until it's condition is falsed
#it circles itself

#let's define a variable and give a value
x = 1
#while loop will check the conditions
while x <= 5:
#this block of code will execute if conditions are true
    print("I am learning python! One day i will be the greatest python developer!")
#in order to prevent from looping forever, we need to increament the value by 1 on each execution
    x += 1
#the while loop function will stop as soon as the conditions turns false


#That's it!
print("\nThe END!")
